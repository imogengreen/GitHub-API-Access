# Task
Part of the coursework for CSU33012 Software Engineering. We were tasked with interrogating the GitHub API and visualising the retrieved data.

# Description
This implementation retrieves data about the repositories belonging to the authenticated user, and then visualises them using D3.js. The visualisation is served using a simple HTTP server which is initialised by running the script

_run-server.sh_

The visualisation can then be viewed by navigating to localhost:8000 in your browser.

# Requirements
**1. Python:** You can check what version of Python is installed on your machine by entering _python --version_ via the command line.

**2. Pip:** This can be installed by running the _get-pip.py_ file that is located within the repository.

**3. PyGithub:** Command for installation: _pip install PyGithub_ 

**4. JSON** (which is a Python module and can simply be imported)
